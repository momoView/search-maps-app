  
I used google maps API and google places API to develop this project when both of these APIs used to be free to use for testing.
You can access these 2 APIs through the google API console. 
I used also @ngrx's Redux directly from the start without developing services.

This the url for a chrome extension that you might need to install for CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing): Allow-Control-Allow-Origin
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf  .

This extension is needed to manage CORS for google places API.
You need to add this link to the whitelisted domains field 'https://proud-limiter-210411.firebaseio.com/*',
to disable CORS for the authentication operations because it's not needed.

The infinite scroll for the visited places used to work once and then doesn't anymore, it serves to load more places
for the old places list once the user scrolls down or up in that list.
