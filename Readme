  
I used google maps API and google places API to develop this project when both of these APIs used to be free to use for testing,
since these 2 APIs aren't free to use for testing anymore, you can't have the full functionality of the application.
You can access these 2 APIs through the google API console. 
I used also @ngrx's Redux directly from the start without developing services.

In the start the user is disconnected, so you cannot interact with the map nor the autocomplete nor the list, you need first
to register a user then login (register & login links in header) then you will be able to use all the elements of the application.

This the url for a chrome extension that you might need to install for CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing): Allow-Control-Allow-Origin
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/allow-cors-access-control/lhobafahddgcelffkeicbaginigeejlf  .

This extension is needed to manage CORS for google places API.
You need to add this link to the whitelisted domains field 'https://proud-limiter-210411.firebaseio.com/*',
to disable CORS for the authentication operations because it's not needed.

The infinite scroll for the visited places used to work once and then doesn't anymore, it serves to load more places
for the old places list once the user scrolls down or up in that list.
